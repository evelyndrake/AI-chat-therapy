# AI Chat Therapy
## Concept
I had a simple idea that AI could be used to simulate conversations for those who want to practice things like setting boundaries.
This is very very *very* quick and dirty, so I might expand upon this later.
## Setup Instructions
- Make a Google AI Studio account
- Get an API key for Google Gemini
- Make a `.env` file and put the key after `API_KEY=`
- Run `npm start` in your console
- Chat!
